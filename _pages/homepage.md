            The Open-CMSIS-Pack project will deliver the infrastructure to integrate and manage software components and improve code reuse across embedded and IoT projects. The project is currently hosted and managed as an incubation project by Linaro in partnership with Arm, NXP and ST.

            Software compatibility for component re-use has long been a challenge in the microcontroller space, especially for the IoT, which is much more diverse at the hardware level compared to PCs or the data center. Open-CMSIS-Pack will remove this complexity, delivering a standard for software component packaging and related foundation tools for validation, distribution, integration, management, and maintenance.

            The [Common Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS)](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/embedded/cmsis) is a vendor-independent hardware abstraction layer for microcontrollers, specifically for Arm Cortex-M processors. CMSIS defines generic tool interfaces and enables consistent device support. The CMSIS software interfaces simplify software reuse and improves time to market for new devices.

            There are a number of CMSIS components, one of which is [CMSIS-Pack technology](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/Pack/html/index.html). Arm has donated CMSIS-Pack to this project, which already provides device support for nearly 9,000 different microcontrollers.
